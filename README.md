# FBXImporter
FBXImporter is a Unity plugin to import fbx model into unity at runtime.
It import fbx model just like you drag it into Unity, all the values in Transform component, RenderFilter component and Renderer component should be the same as you import the fbx model at edit time.

## To use in Unity
1. Copy TestModelImporter/Assets/Plugins/x86_64/FBXImporterUnmanaged.dll to /Assets/Plugins/x86_64 of your Unity project folder
2. Copy TestModelImporter/Assets/Assembly/ModelImporter.dll to /Assets of your Unity project folder
3. Call ModelImporter.Importer.Import( fbxFilePath ) to import model

## To modify source and build
1. The project using swig to wrap c++ interface to Unity, if your don't have it, download at http://www.swig.org/ and install it
2. Open build/WindowsDesktop_vc140.sln, Open Property Page of swig interface file FBXImporter.i, change path under CustomBuildTool/CommandLine to your swig install path
3. Build project FBXImporter, make sure all .cs files FBXGenerated filter of project ModelImporter is generated by swig correctly
4. Build project ModelImporter. If success, you should find native dll bin64/FBXImporterUnmanaged.dll (64bit) or bin/FBXImporterUnmanaged.dll (32bit), and managed dll build/WindowsDesktop_vc140/ModelImporter/bin/Release/ModelImporter.dll
5. Copy them to TestModelImporter project or your own Unity project to test
